This is a Hangman game. The aim of the game is to correctly guess the randomly generated before your character is "hung". 

When started the app will display placeholder "_" in place of each letter of the word which needs to be guessed. 

Using the letter buttons displayed the player should try guess the word represented by the underscores. 

If you correctly guess a letter of the word it will be displayed its place in the word. If you guess a letter which is not in the correct word your character will move closer to being "hung" and the mistake tracker in the top right corner will increase. 

Should you need a refresher on the rules, please click on the "Help" button.
